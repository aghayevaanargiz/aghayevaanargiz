# Hi, I'm Nargiz

I'm interested in the practical applications and theoretical foundations of computer science. My interests include:

- Algorithm development and problem-solving
- Data analysis and machine learning
- Computability theory and the theory of computation
- Analytical and applied mathematics

Currently focused on deepening my understanding of data-driven techniques while continuing to explore the theoretical aspects of computer science. I am actively expanding my knowledge across various research fields.
